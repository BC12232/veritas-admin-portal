This project contains some basic starter code for the Veritas Admin Portal, a web portal coded in Dart. 
Some of the features of our final product, completed in May 2021, are: 
- Viewing participant pairs
- Banning problematic users and viewing malicious user reports
- Creating promotions (e.g., award $5 coffee gift card for new accounts created under "Christianity")
- Accessing coffee chats pairing data for marketing purposes
- Managing other Veritas administrators 

NOTE: Not functional or complete, as we've migrated over to a private repository for proprietary reasons.
